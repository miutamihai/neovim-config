# Neovim Config

This is my Neovim Config. It's based on (and started as a fork of) the fantastic [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Small Showcase

## Useful notes

* I use [Neovide](https://neovide.dev/) as a GUI editor, but the config will work even if you 
don't
* If you _do_ decide to use neovide, make sure to update the `lua/custom/setup/neovide/init.lua` file 
with the nerd font you want to use
* For the ChatGPT integration, you must set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var with your openai api key
